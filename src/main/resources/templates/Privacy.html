    <p>Welcome to our whimsical world!  your privacy is as important to us as our morning coffee. Here’s how we handle your data:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><span class="funny">Data Collection:</span> We might collect personal information like your name, email, and favorite pizza toppings. Yes, we care about your pizza preferences!</li>
        
        <li><span class="funny">How We Use Your Data:</span> Your data helps us improve our site, send you cat memes, and occasionally remind you to hydrate (because, you know, staying healthy is important!).</li>
        
        <li><span class="funny">Sharing Is Not Caring:</span> We don’t sell your data to the highest bidder. Your info stays with us—like your favorite pair of socks that you never want to part with.</li>
        
        <li><span class="funny">Cookies:</span> Yes, we use cookies! But don’t worry, we won’t eat them. We’re talking about the digital kind that help us enhance your browsing experience.</li>
        
        <li><span class="funny">Your Rights:</span> You have the right to know what we collect, the right to make us delete your data (if you want to ghost us), and the right to contact us if you have questions—or just want to share a joke!</li>
        
        <li><span class="funny">Security:</span> We take security seriously, like a cat guarding its favorite toy. We use industry-standard measures to protect your data from mischievous hackers.</li>
        
        <li><span class="funny">Children’s Privacy:</span> Our site is not intended for children under 13. We’re still trying to figure out how to get them to stop eating glue!</li>
        
        <li><span class="funny">Changes to This Policy:</span> We may update this policy from time to time. If we do, we’ll send you a smoke signal, a carrier pigeon, or just a simple email—whichever is more convenient!</li>
    </ol>
